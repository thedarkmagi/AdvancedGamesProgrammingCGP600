- TRIANGLE COLLISIONS! at least 4 points!
- Inverse and Transpose  ( inverse mostly )   ( see advance tut 09 )  -- effectively allows a possible 2 marks 
- specular highlights   ( and well all the other lightings eh ) 
- AI does something on collision with player
- can fully explore and interact with environment  ( + extra actions  Jump or some thing? ) 
- second camera. 
- change particles shape/colour based on use
- pixel shader for lighting 
- evidence of no memory leaks/dangling pointers - show evidence somehow??
